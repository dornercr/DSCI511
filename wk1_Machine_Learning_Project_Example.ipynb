        "- Min-max scaling (many people call this normalization) is the simplest: values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by (maximum - minimum). Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called `MinMaxScaler` for this. It has a `feature_range` hyperparameter that allow to  change the range.\n",
        "- Standardization is different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the standard deviation so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). However, standardization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district had a median income equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush all the other values from 0–15 down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization would not be much affected. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called `StandardScaler` for standardization.\n",
        "- other scalling:\n",
        "    * `MaxAbsScaler`: differs from the previous scaler such that the absolute values are mapped in the range [0, 1]. On positive only data, this scaler behaves similarly to MinMaxScaler and therefore also suffers from the presence of large outliers.\n",
        "    * `RobustScaler`: uses a similar method to the Min-Max scaler but it instead uses the interquartile range, rathar than the min-max, so that it is robust to outliers. After Robust scaling, the distributions are brought into the same scale and overlap, but the outliers remain outside of bulk of the new distributions.\n",
        "    * `Normalizer`: points are all brought within a sphere that is at most 1 away from the origin at any point. Also, the axes that were previously different scales are now all one scale."
