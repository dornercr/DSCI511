        "`reduce()` is also a higher-order function that applies a specified _reduce function_, $f_r$. While `reduce()` takes $f_r$ and a list of values, $v_1\\cdots, v_n$, just like `map()`, there are more restrictions on how $f_r$ must work. Specifically, $f_r(v_a,v_b)$ must take two values as an input and operate both _commutatively_ and _associatively_, producing a single, aggregated output of the same form as the inputs, i.e., $f_r(v_a,v_b) = v_c$. So, why is reduce commutative and associative? So that different processors can recursively operate on the values in any order or grouping&mdash;successive reduce outputs are cycled back into $f_r$ until one single value is left. If a reduce function were not associative and/or commutative, then the order in which pairs of values are reduced can change the final result. So, canonical examples of a reduce function might be addition or multiplication. Since `reduce()` is also a built-in function for Python, we can similarly explore its function. Note: because reduce is all about aggregation, it will produce a single output from a list of input values."

        "Here, the goal might be to find our word counts as totaled across all of the input strings. Well, totaling requires a plus operation, which is commutative and associatve, but it should be done by word, unless a sum across all words is desired, e.g., for normalization. So what would be required of us would be to first collect and then sort our generated word-count output from our map function. In other words, this requires managing our data from map to reduce steps. This is referred to as the map-reduce _shuffle_. Let's charge ahead with our example and see if we can make this work! We have everything we need except a nice neat way to perform the grouping by word, but this is provided by `itertools.groupby()`, which takes a list of values to be grouped as the first, and a function to group by as the second argument. This makes `groupby()` another higher-order function. Note: Python's `groupby()` requires a list that is sorted by the grouping key to function properly."

This takes a lot of effort, and is where specific distributed programming software implementations come into play.

Thus, the type of map-reduce work we've done above can be thought of more as a _control script_ that manages the map-reduce operation.

The idea behind HDFS it to make sure that _data is transmitted (through network) as little as possible_. This is done by spreading data out semi-permanantly across _processing_ nodes. In other words, in an HDFS cluser data \"lives\" at the place where it is generally processed. This means you never have to move Big Data once it has been stored in a cluster, making processing a more-immediate.

This exists as a library called `MRJob`, which you can access via `pip`. While this is quite possibly the nicest way to interact with map-reduce in Python, it also required creating Python classes, which we haven't covered in our programming primer.

They store data in an ordered way that is designed to be passed out to different threads, so we don't have to worry about how data are being partitioned and distributed! Moreover, RDDs are _resilient_. While we haven't brought this up as an issue, distributed processing is also challenging because every thread has to be successful for an entire process to be successful. What this means is that if one computer in a cluster fails, the whole job breaks! Well, RDDs are not only  data objects. They also include the code that operates on the data, but more importantly, keep a record of the code that has been applied to the data and the stages and intermediate data that are successfully produced along the way. What this means is that if a thread fails at any point in a Spark job Spark can automatically restart from the appropriate intermediate position and complete the overall task.

What this means is that data are constantly being read and written, which is slow. The advancement that Spark provided was similar management of data, distributed across the memory of processing computers. So, while Spark will still \"spill\" data to disk if it has to, it does its level best to keep intermediate data in memory, which results in overall faster processing, since data are read/written less often."

        "So, where do we go from here? Well, Spark isn't about making more complex models or data queries, it's really there to make your programs that you _absolutely_ have to run work.  Whether it's because you can't wait for your script to finish on a single thread, or because you don't have enough capacity on a single machine to store and process all of your data, the whole point of spark is making what was computationally intractable using _serial_ programming&mdash;everything we have done on Python until this point&mdash;tractable by using parallelism. Since Spark can be used on a single machine, it might just be some peoples' preference to make work flows in Spark. However, this might some day just be standard practice, since it stages any work being _prototyped_ on a single machine for distribution on a cluster."
